## Aim of the Project
Building and extension to transform ATM keypads and elevator buttons touchless to control the spread of covid-19 virus.

## Material used
 - Arduino Nano
 - LCD 16x2
 - Lazer diodes x8
 - Light Depedent Resisors x8

Total cost ~â‚¹500

## Working
Using lazer beams and light dependent resistors in a matrix setup(4x4), we were able to detect which button was being pressed. The Number was then displayed on the LCD screen.
Features like
- Cancel Transaction 
- Backspace
were also added in the later stage.
